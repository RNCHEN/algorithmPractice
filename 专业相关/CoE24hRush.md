## Question 

对CoE这个岗位的了解



1.曾经设定过很高的目标并达成了的，举一个实例。

When I was a senior high student, I was one of the last 10 students in the class, and my dream school was Sichuan University. The score line at that time was 50 points higher than my score. But I did it. I studied all day, asked my teachers, my classmates and 

2.在做哪一件事情时遇到很大困难，阐述你是如何解决的？

pratice and practice and practice. During those periods , I usually sleep after 12 o' clock.
During my internship as a front-end engineer, I have confronted with one project. It was only two days before the deadline. The customer asked me to change my tree map charts to a mind map chart, which means I need to rewrite all my codes. What's worse, I need to transform from Echatrs to G6. Before that day, I even knew nothing about the G6. How G6 worksThat moment I realized I had trouble and no one could help me. 
For a moment, my heart beat faster, and I began to feel anxious. My mind was blank. About 15min later, when I saw the message on screen "The project has two days left, dont waste time guys". I knew that I needed to face the problem instead of escaping it. 

I took a deep breath and then got back to the work,

The fast way for me to learn a nSew thing in Internet is to read its official document. The G6 has many differences from Echarts, but both of them need to use a special array. So I communicated with the back-end engineer and decided the structure of data we use. Even though I strictly followed the steps according to the document, I still had a lot of problems like the data being undefined, too many rerenders. What I could do is to search errors through the Internet and recheck the official document. I stayed in the company until 2 AM and finally finished the task. In addition, as I introduced before, this project was used by my company, and each team member get some money rewards. 





别人对你的评价是什么？你认为你有哪些优点/缺点？

对我的评价是什么：

乐观开朗，健谈，很守信用，尊重别人，努力,

Optimistic and cheerful, talkative, very trustworthy, respectful and hard working

 每一个阶段相较于上个阶段都有很大的进步，比如初中的时候曾是班上的倒数第五，但是中考完的时候是正数20，高中的时候是倒数10名，出来的时候是正数15.

缺点：

做事粗心，学东西学的有一些浅，没有深究到原理,比较容易满足，自制力比较差，坚持的时间短，想的多做得少

Do things carelessly, learn something shallow, not deep into the principle, more easily satisfied, self-control is poor, persist in a short time , speak more do less







But basically you can prepare for a brief introduction of yourself, project experience and career plan in English. Aside from communication skills, technical skills is the most important, can be oral or written.  





Hello, interviewer. My name is Chen Weigen and my English name is Jeffrey, so you can call me Jeffrey Chen. I'm a student studying in the UESTC. My major is software engineering and I will graduate in June 2023. It is a great pleasure to attend this interview. 

First, I would introduce my learning condition. At present, my GPA reaches 3.86 and the total is 4. I got the pacesetter scholarship in my second year. I could also have won the scholarship in my first year, but I overestimated the standard, I did not submit the form. Finally those who had lower GPA than me got the scholarship. Of course I had passed the CET-4 and CET-6, and both got 550. Nowadays I'm preparing the TOEFL and GRE. In the simulation I got 108 Toefl, so my English ability is up to standard. 

Second, as for my project experience. I participated the China Computer Design Competition in 2021 and 2022, I get the Provincial Second Prize in 2021 and won a chance to participate in the national competition. The final result of this year's project has not come out. I started my internship as a front-end engineer since Feb. I have participated in 4 projects and one of them is used by my company. I also had an experience of machine learning of the Nation University of Singapore. In the project we used Python to build a model to identify the traffic signals and we finally got the highest accuracy among 12 groups and got the third place. Develop a four-axis aircraft with STM32 as the core, and be responsible for the architecture division of mobile products. And debugging work, complete the transplantation of ucOS II operating system, and assist other test developers. 

Finally I want to talk about my career plan.

 A man without tech skills can not convince others and will make mistakes when making companies' plans. Meanwhile, A man just knows some specific tech knowledge can not run a company. My final goal is to become a leader who has the tech skills background.

The Internet is mainstream nowadays and it seems that in the next few decades, the situation will not change, so I want to a job that has a close connection with the Internet. I want to be an engineer who can build something to solve a problem. Also, I want to be a manager who can solve human resource problems. And I want to learn the advanced technologies and concepts of large international enterprises. Therefore, this CoE job is a perfect choice for my own planned career.

#### why our company? 

1. **Culture of collaboration**: meet with mentors, make new friends across the globe and create a thriving personal network.

I have been interested in computer and managment since senior high school. I find that there are too many tasks in my daily life and I'm always busy doing something but finally gain little. At that time I come to realize that I need to manage my tasks systematically. 

At first I used my handwriting to schedule and manage my tasks in my notebook, then I found that my task schedule can have some priority changes, and this time it is not so convenient to modify on paper. Then I started to use some apps like Xmind to assist me. The amount of time I spent on my tasks didn't change, and I wasn't even more attentive, but I found that my gains became more rewarding. This was my first experience of management in real life.

When management is combined with the Internet, it means that the amount of information is geometrically increasing. It used to be possible to understand all the data at a glance, but now it's impossible. To manage data better and study it, you have to find new ways. Then I learned about Enterprise Applications, which I thought was so in line with my goals. Organizing displays and the Internet, two of my favorite factors, were well accomplished at SAP.

that's why I want to apply for SAP
